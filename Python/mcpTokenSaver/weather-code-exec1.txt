Seattle Weather Forecast Demo
========================================

This demonstrates Code Execution with MCP efficiency:

TRADITIONAL APPROACH (Inefficient):
- Full API response: ~7,000-8,000 tokens
- All weather data for 14 periods
- Detailed technical information
- Raw JSON structure
- Everything passes through context window

CODE EXECUTION APPROACH (Efficient):
- Processed summary: ~200-300 tokens  
- Only essential information extracted
- Clean, readable format
- 95%+ token savings!

EXAMPLE PROCESSED OUTPUT:
========================================

This Afternoon: 52°F
Partly Sunny

Tonight: 41°F
Mostly Cloudy

Sunday: 54°F
Partly Sunny

========================================

KEY BENEFITS:
✓ Massive token savings (7000+ → 300 tokens)
✓ Faster processing
✓ Lower costs
✓ More context available for other tasks
✓ Cleaner, more readable output

This is exactly what code execution with MCP provides:
intelligent data processing BEFORE returning to context!
